 Where are you going…
 for your holidays this year?
 We’re going to Dubai in June.
 Didn’t you go there last year?
 Yes, we did.
 We really liked it,
 so we’re going again.
 Can I see you…
 for a few minutes?
 No, I’m busy now.
 I’ve got an appointment.
 But I should be free…
 at half past two.
 Shall we meet then?
